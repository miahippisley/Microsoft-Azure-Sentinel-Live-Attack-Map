<h1>SIEM tutorial: Cyber Attacks Map Using Azure Sentinel </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project uses Microsoft Azure and a virtual machine in the cloud running Windows 10. The VM computer system is set-up to be intentionally compromised, to make it discoverable and enticing to hackers. A log analytics workspace is configured in Azure to ingest custom logs containing information such as latitude, longitude, country and state/province. The log data is collected, queried using Azure Sentinel (the SIEM we use to visualise the data), and displayed in real-time on a heat map showing the physical location and magnitude of the attempted attacks.
<br />

<h2>Tools and requirements:</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure</b> 
- <b>Services within Azure: Log Analytics Workspace and Sentinel (Microsoft's SIEM)</b>
- <b>Kusto Query Language (KQL)</b> 
- <b>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)</b>
- <b>Powershell script written by Josh Makadour:</b> 
- <b>[3rd Party API](https://ipgeolocation.io/)</b>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h2>Step 1: Create a free Azure subscription</h2>
Microsoft Azure offer free Â£200 credit for 30 days

<h2>Step 2: Create a Virtual Machine</h2>
- Search for "Virtual Machines" in the search bar of the "Quickstart Center" page.
<br />
- Select Create > Azure Virtual Machine. Create a new resource group and name it something - mine is called "exposed-lab". 
<br />
<br />
<b>Apply the following settings:</b>
<br />
<br />
- Region: (Europe) UK South
<br />
- Security type: Standard
<br />
- Image: Windows 10 Pro, version 22H2 - x64 Gen2
<br />
- VM architecture: x64
<br />
- Size: Standard_D2s_v3 - 2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory
<br />
- Create a username and password and keep note of them
<br />

<br />
<br />
Click Next to Disc and leave it as the default settings, then continue to Networking.
<br />
- Select NIC network security group > Advanced
<br />
- Select Configure network security group > Create new
<br />
- Remove the default rule
<br />
- Select Add an inbound rule
<br />
<br />
<b>Apply the following settings:</b>
<br />
- Source: Any 
<br />
- Source port ranges: *
<br />
- Destination: Any 
<br />
- Service: Custom
<br />
- Destination port ranges: *
<br />
- Protocol: Any
<br />
- Priority: 100
<br />
- Name: DANGER_ANY_IN
<br />
<br />
This will allow all traffic from the internet into the lab; we want the virtual machine to be enticing to hackers.

<h2>Step 3: Create a Log Analytics Workspace</h2>
Return to the Search bar and visit 'Log Analytics Workspaces' and create a workspace. Enter the name of your resource group created earlier and name your workspace. You can name it anything, but mine is called "law-exposedlab".  
<br />

<br />
We are making a custom log that contains geographic information so we can discover where the attacks are coming from.
